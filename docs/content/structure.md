It contains two classes: `ElectricityMixModel` and `ElectricitySourceModel`.

The `ElectricityMixModel` determines the electricity mix by technology of a specific spatio-temporal context.

The `ElectricitySourceModel` determines the emissions of a spatio-temporal technology mix, drawing on direct emission data from [Climate Trace](https://climatetrace.org/) and embodied emission data from [Get the numbers right (BONSAI)](https://lca.aau.dk/FootprintAnalyser).
